## Introduction

### Concepts

In the `dk` build system, you submit *forms* that produce *objects* created from *assets*.

The **assets** are input materials. These are files and folders that may be remote: source code, data files, audio, image and video files.

A **form** is a document with fields and a submit button. *Tip for engineers*: A form does not need to be entered on a graphical user interface. If you are comfortable with the DOS or Unix terminal, the document is a command line in your terminal. That is, you type the name of an executable followed by options like `--username` as the fields, and then you press ENTER to submit the form. The `dk` scripting system (doc: <https://github.com/diskuv/dk>) is a simple way to make standalone executables/forms.

An **object** is a folder that the form produces.

---

We use the generic term **value** to mean an asset, a form or an object.

All values have names like `YourLibrary_Std.YourPackage.YourThing`. Think of the name as if it were a serial number, as the name uniquely identifies each asset, form and object.

All values also have versions like `1.0.0`. Making a change to a value means creating a new value with the same name but with an increased version. For example, if the text of your 2025-09-04 privacy policy is in the asset `YourOrg_Std.StringsForWebSiteAndPrograms.PrivacyPolicy@1.0.20250904`, an end-of-year update to the privacy policy could be `YourOrg_Std.StringsForWebSiteAndPrograms.PrivacyPolicy@1.0.20251231`. These *semantic* versions offer a lot of flexibility and are industry-standard: [external link: semver 2.0](https://semver.org/). The important point is that values do not change; versions do.

### Early Limitations

Practically speaking, the early versions of the `dk` build system have serious limitations:

- only support forms with no fields. Today that means you have to create new forms whenever you need customization.
- have no graphical user interface or web page for forms (yet!). Everything today must be done from the terminal.

As these limits are removed, this specification document may be updated.

## Assets

Assets are remote or local files that are inputs to a build. All assets have SHA-256 checksums.

Assets are accessed with the [get-asset](#get-asset-id--f-file---d-dir) and [get-asset-file](#get-asset-file-id-file_path--f-file---d-dir) commands described in a later section of the document.

### Local Paths

A path, if it does not start with `https://` or `http://` is a *local* path.

A local path may be either:

- a file
- a directory

A local directory path is always zipped into a zip archive file. For reproducibility, the generated zip archive file will:

- have the zip last modification time to the earliest datetime (Jan 1, 1980 00:00:00)
- have each zip entry with its modification time to the earliest datetime (Jan 1, 1980 00:00:00)
- have each zip file entry set its extended attribute to be a "regular file" with `rw-r--r--` permissions
- use zip compression level 5. That is: "compression method: (2 bytes) ... 5 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 4" at [IANA application/zip]

[IANA application/zip]: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/zip

### Remote Paths

A path, if it starts with `https://` or `http://` is a *remote* path.

## Forms

### Form Variables

#### Variable Availability

Some variables are available in the Value Shell Language (VSL); see [Variables available in VSL](#variables-available-in-vsl)

All variables are available in `.forms.function.args` and `.forms.function.envmods`.

#### ${SLOT.request}

The output directory for the *request slot*. The `-s REQUEST_SLOT` option (ex. `get-object ID@VERSION -s REQUEST_SLOT`) is the request slot.

If the command has no request slot (ex. `get-asset ID@VERSION`) and you use `${SLOT.request}`, an error is reported.

#### ${SLOTNAME.request}

The name of the *request slot*. The `-s REQUEST_SLOT` option (ex. `get-object ID@VERSION -s REQUEST_SLOT`) is the request slot.

If the command has no request slot (ex. `get-asset ID@VERSION`) and you use `${SLOT.request}`, an error is reported.

#### ${SLOT.SlotName}

The output directory for the form function for the slot named `SlotName`.

Output directories for the build system in install mode are the end-user installation directories, while for other modes the output directory may be a sandbox temporary directory.

Expressions are only evaluated if *all* the output types the expression uses are valid for the build system. For example, an expression that uses the output directory `${SLOT.File.Darwin_arm64}` will be skipped by the build system in install mode if the end-user machine's ABI is not `darwin_arm64`.

More generally:

| Type                        | Expression Evaluated? | Immediate Thunk Controller |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `${SLOT.File.Agnostic}`     | Always                | A sandbox directory        |
| `${SLOT.File.Darwin_arm64}` | Always                | A sandbox directory        |

| Type                        | Expression Evaluated?              | Install Thunk Controller |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `${SLOT.File.Agnostic}`     | Always                             | The install directory    |
| `${SLOT.File.Darwin_arm64}` | Only if the end-user machine's ABI | The install directory    |
|                             | is `darwin_arm64`                  |                          |

#### ${MOREINCLUDES}

The directory that the function can place new `*.values.json` values files into. These values will be available to [MORECOMMANDS](#morecommands).

#### ${MORECOMMANDS}

A file containing [zero or more value shell commands](#value-shell-language-vsl) that the function can write into.
Any commands in the file are executed after the precommands and the form function, and after [MOREINCLUDES](#moreincludes) has been scanned, but before the output files are verified.

#### ${/} directory separator

The directory separator. Except for one edge case (below), it is always `/` even on Windows. That is, form commands can assume the `/` separator, which can simplify function code when the function interacts with MSYS2.

There is a special edge case for the build system in install mode: the build system in install mode will set the directory separator to `\` on Windows and `/` on Unix.
This allows installation to canonicalized UNC paths for Windows like the remote file `\\Server2\Share\Test\Foo.txt` or [long-path capable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry) `\\?\C:\Test\Foo.txt`.

#### ${.exe}

The executable suffix. Except for one edge case (below), it is always `.exe` even on Unix. This:

- reduces the need for seperate `.precommands` for Windows and Unix, and separate `.function.args`
- is a performance and space optimization since a common executable suffix increases the chances that non-ABI specific artifacts share the same hash across Windows and Unix.

There is a special edge case for the build system in install mode: the build system in install mode will set the executable suffix to `.exe` on Windows and `` on Unix.

#### ${HOME}

A temporary directory for the form function.

There is a special edge case for the build system in install mode: the build system in install mode will set the home directory to be the OS-specific home directory for the install end-user.

#### ${CACHE}

A temporary directory for the form function.

There is a special edge case for the build system in install mode: the build system in install mode will set the cache directory to be the OS-specific cache directory (ex. `Temporary Internet Files` on Windows, the XDG-compliant cache directory in Unix).

#### ${DATA}

A temporary directory for the form function.

There is a special edge case for the build system in install mode: the build system in install mode will set the data directory to be the OS-specific data directory (ex. `LocalAppData` on Windows, the XDG-compliant data directory in Unix).

#### ${CONFIG}

A temporary directory for the form function.

There is a special edge case for the build system in install mode: the build system in install mode will set the config directory to be the OS-specific config directory (ex. `LocalAppData` on Windows, the XDG-compliant config directory in Unix).

#### ${STATE}

A temporary directory for the form function.

There is a special edge case for the build system in install mode: the build system in install mode will set the state directory to be the OS-specific data directory (ex. `LocalAppData` on Windows, the XDG-compliant state directory in Unix).

#### ${RUNTIME}

A temporary directory for the form function.

There is a special edge case for the build system in install mode: the build system in install mode will set the runtime directory to be the OS-specific data directory (ex. `LocalAppData` on Windows, the XDG-compliant runtime directory in Unix).

### Precommands

The `precommands` are a **set** of commands run *before* an object's `function`. It is not a sequence of commands since you
cannot make assumptions about the order of the precommands.

The following optimizations are allowed:

- Precommands may be run in parallel.
- Precommands may be skipped if the requested slot does not match the precommand output slot.
  For example, let's say you issue the command `get-object THE_ID -s File.Agnostic`.
  Let's also say `THE_ID` object has two precommands:
  1. `get-asset-file ... -f ${SLOT.File.Agnostic}`
  2. `get-object ... -d ${SLOT.Something.Else}`
  Then the second precommand may be skipped because the requested slot `File.Agnostic` does not match `Something.Else`.

### Environment Modifications

The names in the environment follow the [POSIX specification](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html), except on Windows the environment names are folded to be case-insensitive.
The rules are:

- The character set for the environment names is the [Portable Character Set](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap06.html#tagtcjh_3) except `=` (`<U003D>`) and `NUL`.
- The environment name can't start with a digit
- MlFront restricts more strictly than POSIX for whitespace: the only whitespace accepted are spaces (`<U0020>`). Linefeeds and other non-space whitespace are not accepted.
- MlFront restricts more strictly than POSIX for control characters: the `BEL` (`<U0007>`) is not accepted.

The values in the environment are encoded as UTF-8 and may contain [variables](#form-variables).

Because the first character of an environment modification unambiguously determines the type of modification, like `+` in `+NAME=VALUE` or `-` in `-NAME`, no escaping of environment names or values is required.

#### +NAME=VALUE

Add or set the environment variable with name `NAME` to `VALUE`.

The `VALUE` may contain [variables](#form-variables).

You may use `NAME=` to set the environment variable to empty. It is preferable to use [-NAME](#-name) since programs have inconsistent behavior when environment variables are empty; some treat empty as an unset environment variable, while others treat empty as empty.

#### -NAME

Remove the environment variable with name `NAME`.

#### <NAME=VALUE

Prepends `VALUE` and a path separator to the environment variable with name `NAME`.
However, the path seperator (`;` or `:` on Windows or Unix, respectively) is not added if the environment variable is empty.

The `VALUE` may contain [variables](#form-variables).

For example, `PATH+=C:\Windows\system32` prepends `C:\Windows\system32;` to the PATH on Windows and prepends `C:\Windows\system32:` to the PATH on Unix.
In this example, the Unix prepending does not make sense, which is why the best practice is to use [variables](#form-variables) for the `VALUE`
like `PATH+=${CACHE}${/}bin` so the modification is portable across operating systems.

### Behavior

The order of processing is as follows:

1. The form's precommands are executed, in parallel if supported by the build system.
2. The form's function is executed.
3. If [${MORECOMMANDS}](#morecommands) is part of the form's arguments or precommands, then:
   1. The [${MOREINCLUDES}](#moreincludes) directory is scanned for `values.json[c]` and `*.values.json[c]`.
   2. All scanned values are made available to this form. However, the values are *not available globally* to any other form because globally means the dependency order between the newly scanned values and existing or new forms can't be determined consistently.
   3. The shell commands in `${MORECOMMANDS}` are run.
4. The output files are verified to exist.
5. The [`${SLOT.slotname}`](#slotslotname) that are part of the form's arguments and precommands are made available to other forms.

## Objects

An object is a BLOB, which is a sequence of bytes. The object may be categorized by how the object comes to exist:

- a "generated" object created by a [form](#forms)
- anything else is an "input" object. For example, a file in your project may be an "input" object.

But to re-iterate: There is no concept of an object being a "file" or a "directory".
The object is just a sequence of bytes.

In both cases the build system treats the objects as immutable,
and the objects may be cached and/or persisted to disk whenever necessary.

When a value shell command is being run (described in the upcoming [Value Shell Language](#value-shell-language-vsl) section),
an object is made available on disk. At this time an object is "realized" into either a file or a directory.
That is the subject of the next [Saving and Loading Objects](#saving-and-loading-objects) section.

> Design Note: Why blur the distinction between files and directories?
> These objects are meant to be *cloud-friendly* so they need to
> have a canonical representation on cloud value stores like AWS S3. We don't need strict typing everywhere!
> And using a compressed archive means accessing the multiple
> outputs of a form function is quite straightforward; in contrast, other build systems expose the user to added complexity
> (confer: [make: Handling Tools that Produce Many Outputs](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Multiple-Outputs.html)).

### Saving and Loading Objects

When a value shell command reads an immutable object and saves it to a file (ex.
[get-object -f FILE](#get-object-id--s-request_slot--f-file---d-dir)),
the bytes of the immutable object are copied directly to the file.

When a value shell command reads an immutable object and saves it to a directory (ex.
[get-object -d DIR](#get-object-id--s-request_slot--f-file---d-dir)),
the bytes of the immutable object are:

- *when the bytes have a zip file header* uncompressed and unzipped into the directory
- *when the bytes do not have a zip file header* copied into the directory in a file named `THUNKOBJ`

When a value shell command saves a file as an immutable object, the file's bytes are saved as-is.

When a value shell command saves a directory as an immutable object, the directory is zipped and the zip archive bytes are saved.

That sounds inefficient, but the build system is allowed to optimize a set of value shell commands.
For example, if one shell command saves output into a directory,
and a second shell command reads data from created by the first shell command,
the build system can give the second shell command a symlink to the first directory
**without** using a zip archive as an intermediate artifact.

### Object Slots

Each object has one or more slots. Each slot is a container for the object's files.

There are no built-in slots. However, `File.Agnostic` is the conventional slot for files that are ABI-agnostic.

The names of the slots are period-separated "MlFront standard namespace terms". Each of these terms:

- are drawn from the character set `'A' .. 'Z' | 'a' .. 'z' | '0' .. '9' | '_'`
- must start with a capital letter
- must not contain a double underscore (`__`)
- must not be a MlFront library identifier (ie. a double camel cased string followed by an underscore and another camel cased string, like `XyzAbc_Def`)

## Values

### Value Shell Language (VSL)

**All encodings of VSL are UTF-8 unless explicitly noted as different.**

There is a POSIX shell styled language to query for objects and assets.
For example, the "command":

```sh
get-object OurStd_Std.Build.Clang@1.0.0 -s File.Agnostic -f clang.exe
```

will get the object with the id `OurStd_Std.Build.Clang@1.0.0` and place it in the `clang.exe` file.

There are two ways to run these shell commands:

1. Directly from the command line with the efficient `dk` implementation or the reference implementation `mlfront-shell`. For example, `dk get-object OurStd_Std.Build.Clang@1.0.0 -s File.Agnostic -f clang.exe`.
2. Embedded as "precommands" in a values file. For example,

   ```json
   { // ...
    "precommands": {
      "private": [
        "get-object OurStd_Std.Build.Clang@1.0.0 -s File.Agnostic -f clang.exe"
      ]
    },
    // ...
   }
   ```

When embedded as precommands in a values file, the command line (which is a JSON string) is split into arguments (a list of strings) using the [POSIX quoting rules at IEEE Std 1003.1-2024 / Shell & Utilities / Shell Command Language / 2.2 Quoting](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_19_02). However, no Here-Documents are accepted. The splitting is similar to Python's [shlex.split](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.split).

All commands have a output path (ex. `-f echo.exe`). Most command have two forms:

- `-f FILE` (ex. `-f echo.exe`)
- `-d DIR/` or `-d DIR\\` (ex. `-d target/`)

but some commands may only have the `-d DIR/` or `-d DIR\\` directory output.

The best practice is to use the forward slash (`/`) as directory separator in the output paths for readability (no escaping in JSON) and portability (forward slashes don't work on Unix).
However, when the directory is a UNC path on Windows (ex. `\\Server2\Share\Test\Foo.txt`) you should use backward slashes.

For security, the commands may be evaluated in a sandbox or a chroot environment. Do not use `..` path segments or they may fail to resolve in sandboxes.

#### get-object ID -s REQUEST_SLOT (-f FILE | -d DIR/)

Get the contents of the slot `REQUEST_SLOT` for the object uniquely identified by identifier `ID`.

| Option      | Description                                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f FILE`   | Place object in `FILE`                                                        |
| `-d DIR/`   | The object must be a zip archive, and its contents are extracted into `DIR/`. |
| `-n STRIP`  | See [Option: [-n STRIP]](#option--n-strip)                                    |
| `-m MEMBER` | See [Option: [-m MEMBER](#option--m-member)]                                  |

See [Options: -f FILE and -d DIR](#options--f-file-and--d-dir) for output path restrictions.

The object `ID` implicitly or explicitly contains build metadata; see [ID with Build Metadata](#object-id-with-build-metadata).

#### install-object ID -s REQUEST_SLOT (-f FILE | -d DIR/)

Install the contents of the slot `REQUEST_SLOT` for the object uniquely identified by identifier `ID`.

| Option      | Description                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-f FILE`   | Install object to `FILE`                                                                               |
| `-d DIR/`   | Install contents of the zip archive to the install directory `DIR/`. The object must be a zip archive. |
| `-n STRIP`  | See [Option: [-n STRIP]](#option--n-strip)                                                             |
| `-m MEMBER` | See [Option: [-m MEMBER](#option--m-member)]                                                           |

**More than one `install-object` can use the same install directory `DIR`**.

See [Options: -f FILE and -d DIR](#options--f-file-and--d-dir) for output path restrictions.

The object `ID` implicitly or explicitly contains build metadata; see [ID with Build Metadata](#object-id-with-build-metadata).

#### pipe-object ID -s REQUEST_SLOT -x PIPE

> Deprecated. This command will be replaced by dynamic tasks.

Write the contents of the slot `REQUEST_SLOT` for the object uniquely identified by identifier `ID` to the pipe named `PIPE`.

| Option      | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `-m MEMBER` | See [Option: [-m MEMBER](#option--m-member)] |

The object `ID` implicitly or explicitly contains build metadata; see [ID with Build Metadata](#object-id-with-build-metadata).

No two `pipe-object` commands may write to the same pipe `PIPE`.

The location of the pipe is available using the variable `${PIPE.name}`.

Typically, the pipe given to the form function will be a PIPE_ACCESS_OUTBOUND named pipe server on Windows (ex. `\\ServerName\pipe\SomePipe`) and a write-only fifo pipe on Unix. To be portable, you should:

- read from the pipe zero or one time. Do not re-read from the pipe.
- read the data sequentially from the pipe. Do not use random access read in the pipe.
- expect the read from the pipe, especially the first byte, to take a long time.
- use PowerShell or a library in your favorite language to detect and read from the named pipe on Windows

Piping is an **optimization**. If the build system does not support threading, the pipe *will* be a regular file. However, if pipeline is supported, then the build system only has to kick off the build of the form function dependency `ID SLOT` when you *first access the pipe*.

Key Optimization: If you don't access the pipe at all in your form function, then you have saved the cost (clock time, compute, space) of the build for your dependency `ID SLOT`.

So in situations where the content is conditional (ie. read by the form function only in certain situations) and expensive (ie. the `ID SLOT` is large or has a time-consuming build), use `pipe-object`.

Here is an example use of a pipe:

#### get-asset-file ID FILE_PATH (-f FILE | -d DIR/)

Get the contents of the asset file at `FILE_PATH` for the asset with identifier `ID`.

NOTE: If the version of the asset's `ID` is just a `MAJOR.MINOR` then the **latest** asset patch number for that major, minor combination is fetched.

| Option      | Description                                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f FILE`   | Place asset file in `FILE`                                                        |
| `-d DIR/`   | The asset file must be a zip archive, and its contents are extracted into `DIR/`. |
| `-n STRIP`  | See [Option: [-n STRIP]](#option--n-strip)                                        |
| `-m MEMBER` | See [Option: [-m MEMBER](#option--m-member)]                                      |

See [Options: -f FILE and -d DIR](#options--f-file-and--d-dir) for output path restrictions.

#### get-asset ID (-f FILE | -d DIR/)

Get the archive file for the asset with identifier `ID`.

NOTE: If the version of the asset's `ID` is just a `MAJOR.MINOR` then the **latest** asset patch number for that major, minor combination is fetched.

| Option     | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f FILE`  | Place asset in `FILE`. `FILE` will be a zip archive with **all** the asset files. |
| `-d DIR/`  | **All** the asset files will be extracted into `DIR/`.                            |
| `-n STRIP` | See [Option: [-n STRIP]](#option--n-strip)                                        |

See [Options: -f FILE and -d DIR](#options--f-file-and--d-dir) for output path restrictions.

*What about the `-m MEMBER` option?*

Use [get-asset-file](#get-asset-file-id-file_path--f-file---d-dir) to get a specific asset file.
Having a `-m MEMBER` option would be equivalent but redundant and slightly confusing since
not much about assets implies they are stored as archives.

#### Options: -f FILE and -d DIR

No command may write to the same file. Specifically:

- It is an error to have more than one `get-object` or `get-asset` or `get-asset-file` or `resume-object` or `install-object` use the same `FILE`.
- It is an error to have more than one `get-object` or `get-asset` or `get-asset-file` or `resume-object` use the same `DIR` or otherwise overlap the same `DIR`. Overlapping means one command can't write to the subdirectory of another command's `DIR`.

Use [`install-object`](#install-object-id--s-request_slot--f-file---d-dir) when you want to write into the same directory.
Even so, no `install-object` may extracted the same file in the same install directory.

#### Option: [-n STRIP]

`-n STRIP` defaults to zero.

`STRIP` is how many levels of the zip archive to strip. Many zip archives place all content under a versioned root directory:

```text
llvmorg-19.1.3-win32/
  LICENSE.txt
  README.txt
  src/
```

To leave the directory structure as-is, set `STRIP` to `0`. To strip away the top level `llvmorg-19.1.3-win32` directory, set `STRIP` to `1`.

#### Option: [-m MEMBER]

Gets the zip file member from the object or asset file, which must be a zip archive.

#### Object ID with Build Metadata

These rules apply to the `*-object` commands **only**:

- `get-object ID@VERSION ...`
- `install-object ID@VERSION ...`
- `pipe-object ID@VERSION ...`
- `enter-objectID@VERSION ...`

The purpose of these rules is to ensure that unique builds can be uniquely and deterministically identified.

Versions can have explicit build metadata.
For example, the VERSION `1.0.0+bn-20250801235901.commit-054d5983` has the two dot-separated build metadata fields: `bn-20250801235901` and `commit-054d5983`.

If the version `VERSION` has explicit build metadata in the format `bn-*`, then the object is **locked** to that specific build number.
In the above example the object is locked to build number `20250801235901` because that is the build metadata with format `bn-*`.

When the version `VERSION` has no explicit build metadata, or the version `VERSION`'s build metadata does not include a `bn-*` field, then the first matching rule of the following rules determines what the build metadata will be:

1. If a lockfile (not available yet in the reference implementation) has a build metadata reference (ex. `1.0.0` = `bn-20250801235901+commit-054d5983`), the build metadata is used.
2. The constructive trace store list of traces `key(i), dependencies(i), result(i)` is scanned. If there is a trace `i` where the version of `key(i)` matches the `VERSION` and where `result(i)` is an object value, then the build metadata of the *latest* such `key(i)` will be used.
3. The build metadata will be constructed from mlfront-shell's or dk's `-t TIMESTAMP` command line option, with the `bn-YYYYMMDDhhmmss` format.
4. The build metadata will be `bn-20250101000000`.

Important: the system clock is never consulted.

In CI, the best practice is to use the `-t TIMESTAMP` option, and base it on either:

- the source control commit timestamp.
  - Pro: Very easy to go back to the source code.
  - Con: If you need to force a new build from existing source code, you must create an empty commit-
- a monotonically increasing build number (ex. `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` if you use GitHub Actions).
  - Pro: No empty commits.
  - Con: Depending on your CI provider, it may be hard to go from a build number back to the source code.

Here are some examples for using the source control commit timestamp:

```yaml
# file: .github/workflows/example-build.yml

# CI System: GitHub Actions
# Variable Name: github.event.head_commit-timestamp
- name: Build project
  run: mlfront-shell -t "${{ github.event.head_commit-timestamp }}" ...
```

```yaml
# file: .gitlab-ci.yml

# CI System: GitLab CI
# Docs: https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/predefined_variables/#predefined-variables
# Variable Name: CI_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP
# Variable Example: 2022-01-31T16:47:55-08:00
job:
  script:
    - mlfront-shell -t "$CI_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP" ...
```

Here are some example of using a monotonically increasing build number:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions: GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/variables
# GitLab CI: CI_PIPELINE_IID https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/predefined_variables/
# Azure Pipelines: Build.BuildId https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml

# FILLMEIN ... wait for `-n RUN_NUMBER` option to complement `-t TIMESTAMP`
# FILLMEIN ... `-n` includes leading zeroes so lexographic comparisons work
```

### JSON Schema

The schema is at [etc/jsonschema/mlfront-value.json](../etc/jsonschema/mlfront-value.json).

### JSON Canonicalization

The form is reconstructed as JSON exactly with the following keys (and only the following keys) in the exact order:

1. `assets.files.checksum.sha1`
2. `assets.files.checksum.sha256`
3. `assets.files.path`
4. `assets.listing_unencrypted.name`
5. `assets.listing_unencrypted.version`
6. `forms.function.args`
7. `forms.function.envmods`
8. `forms.id.name`
9. `forms.id.package`
10. `forms.id.version`
11. `forms.outputs.files.paths`
12. `forms.outputs.files.slots`
13. `forms.precommands.private`
14. `forms.precommands.public`
15. `schema_version.major`
16. `schema_version.minor`

with:

- all whitespace between JSON tokens removed from the canonicalized JSON
- all non-existent array values replaced with empty arrays, and all non-existent boolean balues replaced with `false`
- all `assets.files` sorted by the ascending lexographical UTF-8 byte encoding of `assets.files.path`
- `assets.files.checksum.sha1` removed if `assets.files.checksum.sha256` is present

The above canonicalization should conform to [RFC 8785]; if there are any ambiguities [RFC 8785] must be followed.

Of particular note is that the `assets.listing.origins`, `assets.files.origin`
and `assets.files.size` fields are not present in the canonicalization since
the asset path and checksum uniquely identifiy an asset file. In other words,
if you have a locally cached file with the same checksum as a remote asset,
you can substitute the locally cached file without changing identifiers
in the value store.

[RFC 8785]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785

## Graph

### Nodes

Each node in the graph has a key, a value id, a value sha256 and the value itself:

- The **key** is one of two types:
  - A **module key** is what you -- the user -- specify in a shell command as the MODULE_ID and SLOT or PATH in the [Value Shell Language](#value-shell-language-vsl)
  - A **checksum key** is the SHA-256 of some content
- A **value id** is a string which is a *value type* (defined below) and a set of fields, concatenated together and then SHA-256 base32-encoded. The value id serves as a unique key for the value in a value store.
  - The **value type** is a single letter that categorizes what the value is:

    | Value Type | What                | Docs                        |
    | ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | `o`        | object              | [Objects](#objects)         |
    | `a`        | asset               | [Assets](#assets)           |
    | `p`        | asset file          | [Assets](#assets)           |
    | `f`        | form                | [Forms](#forms)             |
    | `v`        | values file         | [JSON Schema](#json-schema) |
    | `w`        | values (parsed AST) | [JSON Schema](#json-schema) |
    | `c`        | built-in constants  | [Objects](#objects)         |
    | `d`        | debug source file   | FILLMEIN                    |

    All value types are *lowercase* for support on case-insensitive file systems.

- A **value** is a file whose content matches the value tppe. A values file is a `value.json` build file itself. An object is a zip archive of the output of a [form](#forms). Form, asset and asset file value are serialized parsed abstract syntax trees.
- A **value sha256** is a SHA-256 hex-encoded string of the value. That is, if you ran `certutil` (Windows), `sha256sum` (Linux) or `shasum -a 256` (macOS) on the value file, the *value sha256* is what you would see.

| Value Type | Value Id before SHA256 and base32          | Value                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |

| `w`        | [VCI](#vci---values-canonical-id)          | parsed `{schema_version:,forms:,assets:}`  |
| `a`        | [ACI](#aci---asset-canonical-id)           | parsed                                     |
|            | + [CT](#ct---compatibility-tag)            | `{listing_unencrypted:, listing:, files:}` |
| `o`        | [P256](#p256---sha256-of-asset-file)       | contents of asset file                     |
| `o`        | [Z256](#z256---sha256-of-zip-archive-file) | contents of zip archive file               |

#### V256 - SHA256 of Values File

The SHA-256 (raw, not hex-encoded) of the `values.json` file that contains the asset (or form or asset file).

#### P256 - SHA256 of Asset File

The hex-encoded SHA-256 of the asset file. It is the `checksum.sha256` in the following asset file:

```json
{
  "origin": "github-release",
  "path": "SHA256.sig",
  "size": 151,
  "checksum": {
    "sha256": "0d281c9fe4a336b87a07e543be700e906e728becd7318fa17377d37c33be0f75"
  }
}
```

#### Z256 - SHA256 of Zip Archive File

The hex-encoded SHA-256 of the zip archive generated from either:

- the output directory of a form
- the asset directory for one or more asset files

#### CT - Compatibility Tag

A string with the format `oc<OCAMLVERSION>_ws<OCAMLWORDSIZE>`.

For example, `oc414_wd64` is OCaml 4.14 with a 64-bit word size.

#### VCI - Values Canonical ID

The hex-encoded SHA256 of the `values.json` *canonicalized* JSON.

#### ACI - Asset Canonical ID

The hex-encoded SHA256 of the asset's *canonicalized* JSON.

An example *before* removing whitespace as per [JSON Canonicalization](#json-canonicalization):

```json
{
  "listing_unencrypted": {
    "spec_version": 2,
