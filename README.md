# dk - A script runner, cross-compiler and build tool

Running and cross-compiling scripts with `dk` solves the problem of **README-itis**:
 you give your users a lengthy README document, your users fail to setup your software, and you lose a user forever.

`dk` solves README-itis in two ways:

1. You model your actions (all that stuff you would put into a README) with scripts that `dk` will cross-compile for your users's platforms.
2. All required actions are executed as needed on your end-users' machines with dk's build tool.

Skip down to [Comparisons](#comparisons) for how `dk` fits in the ecosystem. TLDR: `dk` is similar to the Nix package manager (except `dk` works on Windows) and to Docker (except not as heavy).

The build tool is quite new and has not yet been integrated into the script runner. But it has a reference implementation, and specifications are at [docs/SPECIFICATION.md](docs/SPECIFICATION.md).

Separately, a [Quick Start for Scripting](#quick-start---scripting) is below, and the main documentation site for the script runner is <https://diskuv.com/dk/help/latest/>.

## Quick Start - Build Tool

**Install** on Windows with PowerShell, or macOS or Linux with your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/diskuv/dk.git
dk/mlfront-shell --version
```

That will do a one-time download of a small binary (< 10MB), and
give you access to the community-submitted packages (*pending*) in
<https://github.com/diskuv/dk/tree/1.0/pkgs/include>.

**Download your first cloud asset** with:

```sh
dk/mlfront-shell -- get-asset-file DkExe_Std.Asset@2.4.202508011516-signed -p dk-darwin_arm64 -f binary-for-darwin_arm64
```

That downloaded an executable `dk-darwin_arm64` which is the `dk` script runner for Apple Silicon.
Change the path to `dk-windows_x86_64`, `dk-windows_x86`, `dk-linux_x86_64`, `dk-linux_x86` or `dk-darwin_x86_64` for other operating systems.

Run it with:

```sh
./binary-for-darwin_arm64 --help
```

Congratulations! Hint: Later you will do [Quick Start for Scripting](#quick-start---scripting) that makes real use of that script runner.

**Download your first object** with:

```sh
dk/mlfront-shell -- get-object DkExe_Std.Asset.Latest@1.0.202501010000 -s File.Darwin_arm64 -d dir-for-darwin_arm64
```

Objects (ie. `get-object`) have build commands embedded in them. Think of them like build targets with one or more outputs.
The `DkExe_Std.Asset.Latest` object has build commands that gets the latest `dk` executable asset for you.

If we inspect our new directory, we'll see:

```sh
# Windows
PS1> dir dir-for-darwin_arm64
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---            1/1/1980 12:00 AM        8810960 dk

# Unix
$ ls -l dir-for-darwin_arm64
-rw-r--r--  1 jonah  staff  8810960 Jan  1  1980 dk
```

All of the dates are set to Jan 1, 1980 for reproducibility.

**Explore more with the schema**. If you have an IDE/editor that supports JSON schema like Visual Studio Code,
you can create a build file with the following content (save it with a `.thunk.jsonc` extension):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/diskuv/dk/raw/refs/heads/1.0/etc/jsonschema/mlfront-thunk.json"
}
```

and you will get auto-completion for your build file.

Then you can run it with:

```sh
dk/mlfront-shell -I the/directory/to/your/build/file -- get-object YourLibrary_Something.Something@1.0.202501010000 -s File.Agnostic
```

Almost any command you have been doing with `dk/mlfront-shell ... -- THE-COMMAND ...` you can do inside the "precommands" of your build file.

**Shell into your first build** with:

> 2025-08-29: There are [two serious performance bugs](https://github.com/diskuv/dk/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22performance%22) where all assets are downloaded, each time.
> Sorry! I wouldn't recommend doing this unless you have tens of minutes to wait.

```sh
# Only for Apple Silicon ...

$ dk/mlfront-shell -- enter-object DkDistribution_Std.Asset.Latest@1.0.202501010000 -s File.Darwin_arm64

## Quick Start - Scripting

<!-- SYNC: site:src/content/docs/guide/dk-quick-walkthrough.mdoc, dk.git:README.md#quickstart -->

Install on Windows:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Diskuv.dk
```

or Apple/Silicon:

```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/dk https://diskuv.com/a/dk-exe/2.4.202506160116-signed/dk-darwin_arm64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dk
```

or Apple/Intel:

```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/dk https://diskuv.com/a/dk-exe/2.4.202506160116-signed/dk-darwin_x86_64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dk
```

or Linux with glibc and libstdc++ (Debian, Ubuntu, etc. but not Alpine):

```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/dk https://diskuv.com/a/dk-exe/2.4.202506160116-signed/dk-linux_x86_64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dk
[ -x /usr/bin/dnf ] && sudo dnf install -y libstdc++
```

Then cross-compile a script to standalone Windows, Linux, Android executables (and to a macOS executable if you are on a macOS machine):

```sh
dk -g dune -S "
    module Http = DkNet_Std.Http
    module Uri = Tr1Uri_Std.Uri
    let print_endline = Tr1Stdlib_V414Io.StdIo.print_endline
 " -U "
    print_endline @@
    Lwt_main.run @@
    Http.fetch_url ~max_sz:4096 @@
    Uri.of_string {|https://jigsaw.w3.org/HTTP/h-content-md5.html|}
 " -O ReleaseSmall Exe
```

The executables will be available in the `target/` folder:

```sh
file target/ZzZz_Zz.Adhoc-* | cut -c1-69 | awk '{print $0 "..."}'

target/ZzZz_Zz.Adhoc-android_arm32v7a:   ELF 32-bit LSB pie executabl...

```

32-bit targets are not ready yet. <https://github.com/diskuv/dk/issues> has the full list of issues.

The following are tools specific to the OCaml language, and `dk` should not replace them. Skip this table you are not an OCaml-er.

| Tool | Features better with the tool | Features better with `dk`            |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| opam | Thousands of packages         | Immutable storage. Binary artifacts. |
| dune | Watch mode. Fast              | Extensible. Not tied to OCaml.       |
