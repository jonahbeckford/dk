# dk - A script runner, cross-compiler and build tool

Running and cross-compiling scripts with `dk` solves the problem of **README-itis**:
 you give your users a lengthy README document, your users fail to setup your software, and you lose a user forever.

`dk` solves README-itis in two ways:

1. You model your actions (all that stuff you would put into a README) with scripts that `dk` will cross-compile for your users's platforms.
2. All required actions are executed as needed on your end-users' machines with dk's build tool.

Skip down to [Comparisons](#comparisons) for how `dk` fits in the ecosystem. TLDR: `dk` is similar to the Nix package manager (except `dk` works on Windows) and to Docker (except not as heavy).

The build tool is quite new and has not yet been integrated into the script runner. But it has a working reference implementation, and specifications are at [docs/SPECIFICATION.md](docs/SPECIFICATION.md).

A [Quick Start for Scripting](#quick-start---scripting) is below, and the main documentation site for the script runner is <https://diskuv.com/dk/help/latest/>.

## Quick Start - Build Tool

**Install** on Windows with PowerShell, or macOS or Linux with your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/diskuv/dk.git
dk/mlfront-shell --version
```

That will do a one-time download of a small binary (< 10MB), and
give you access to the community-submitted packages (*pending*) in
<https://github.com/diskuv/dk/tree/1.0/pkgs/include>.

**Fetch your first artifact** with:

```sh
dk/mlfront-shell -- get-asset-file DkDistribution_Std.Asset@2.4.202508011516-signed -p dk-darwin_arm64 -f dk-darwin_arm64
```

That downloaded an executable `dk-darwin_arm64` which is the `dk` script runner for Apple Silicon.
Change the path to `dk-windows_x86_64`, `dk-windows_x86`, `dk-linux_x86_64`, `dk-linux_x86` or `dk-darwin_x86_64` for other operating systems.

Run it with:

```sh
./dk-darwin_arm64 --help
```

Hint: Later you will do [Quick Start for Scripting](#quick-start---scripting) that makes real use of that script runner.

**Build your first package** with:

```sh
dk/mlfront-shell -- get-object DkDistribution_Std.Asset.Latest@1.0.202501010000 -s File.Darwin_arm64 -f dk-darwin_arm64
```

## Quick Start - Scripting

<!-- SYNC: site:src/content/docs/guide/dk-quick-walkthrough.mdoc, dk.git:README.md#quickstart -->

Install on Windows:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Diskuv.dk
```

or Apple/Silicon:

```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/dk https://diskuv.com/a/dk-exe/2.4.202506160116-signed/dk-darwin_arm64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dk
```

or Apple/Intel:

```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/dk https://diskuv.com/a/dk-exe/2.4.202506160116-signed/dk-darwin_x86_64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dk
```

or Linux with glibc and libstdc++ (Debian, Ubuntu, etc. but not Alpine):

```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/dk https://diskuv.com/a/dk-exe/2.4.202506160116-signed/dk-linux_x86_64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dk
[ -x /usr/bin/dnf ] && sudo dnf install -y libstdc++
```

Then cross-compile a script to standalone Windows, Linux, Android executables (and to a macOS executable if you are on a macOS machine):

```sh
dk -g dune -S "
    module Http = DkNet_Std.Http
    module Uri = Tr1Uri_Std.Uri
    let print_endline = Tr1Stdlib_V414Io.StdIo.print_endline
 " -U "
    print_endline @@
    Lwt_main.run @@
    Http.fetch_url ~max_sz:4096 @@
    Uri.of_string {|https://jigsaw.w3.org/HTTP/h-content-md5.html|}
 " -O ReleaseSmall Exe
```

The executables will be available in the `target/` folder:

```sh
file target/ZzZz_Zz.Adhoc-* | cut -c1-69 | awk '{print $0 "..."}'

target/ZzZz_Zz.Adhoc-android_arm32v7a:   ELF 32-bit LSB pie executabl...

```

32-bit targets are not ready yet. <https://github.com/diskuv/dk/issues> has the full list of issues.

## Comparisons

*Italics* are pending feature.

| Tool      | Features better with the tool | Features better with `dk`          |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Nix       | Huge set of packages          | Works on Windows                   |
| (contd.)  |                               | *Signify-backed supply chain*      |
| Buck2 +   | Scales to millions of files   | Works well outside of monorepo     |
| ... Bazel | Backed by Big Tech            | Easier to adopt                    |
| Ninja     | Integrated with CMake. Fast   | Cloud-friendly, sharable artifacts |
| (contd.)  | Rules to simplify build files | *Pending integration in scripts*   |
| (contd.)  | Multithreading                | *Pending integration in dk*        |
| Docker    | Huge set of images            | Works well on Windows              |
| (contd.)  | Works very well in CI         | Works in CI and *during installs*  |

The following are tools specific to the OCaml language, and `dk` should not replace them. Skip this table you are not an OCaml-er.

| Tool | Features better with the tool | Features better with `dk`      |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| opam | Thousands of packages         | Immutable storage              |
| dune | Watch mode. Fast              | Extensible. Not tied to OCaml. |
